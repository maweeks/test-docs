### Map

The map tab is the default tab that will be visible when you open the app. It allows you to search around the area and look at the different interests around the pond.

#### Base map

The map uses Google Maps to visualise the Fleet Pond area. You can switch to satellite view using the button in the top left corner. Points of interest, routes and your location can be shown on the map.

#### Points of interest

![Red marker][markerRed]

Points of interest are shown with red markers on the map. Clicking on one will show the name of the interest and clicking on that will take you to the page about that point of interest.

![Blue marker][markerBlue]

The blue markers show the location of benches.

#### Location

![Location marker][markerLocation]

If you allow the app to use your location, it will be shown with a blue dot with pulsating rings. The persistant ring shows how accurate your location reading is.

**Your location is only used locally on your device, and is not stored anywhere.**

#### Map buttons

There are two buttons available in the bottom right of the screen.

![Location button][buttonLocation]

The location button, only shown if your gps location is available, will lock the map to your location keeping your position centred on the map. The button will glow blue when locked to your location, tap the button again to disable the location lock. The map will only be centered to your location when you have an accurate reading.

![Map button][buttonMap]

The map button centres you back onto the pond, resetting to the default map view.

#### Key

The content of the map can be shown / hidden using the key on the left. The available map content:

* **Overlay** - A map overlay that shows place names, landforms, and the routes available to walk at the pond.
* **Interests** - The red markers on the map that show the locations of the points of interests.
* **Benches** - The blue markers on the map that show the locations of the benches around the pond.
* **Routes** - Each route can be individually hidden from the map.

You can use the chevron at the top of the key to show / hide the window.

#### Offline Usage
