#### Base map

The map uses Google Maps to visualise the Fleet Pond area. You can switch to terrain view using the button in the top left corner. Points of interest, routes and your location can be shown on the map.

#### Points of interest

![Red marker][markerRed]

Points of interest are shown with red markers on the map. Clicking on one will show the name of the interest and clicking on that will take you to the page about that point of interest.

The blue markers show the location of benches.

#### Map buttons

There are two buttons available in the bottom right of the screen.

![Location button][buttonLocation]

The location button, only shown if your gps location is available, will lock the map to your location keeping your position centered on the map. The button will glow blue when locked to your location, tap the button again to disable the location lock.

![Map button][buttonMap]

The map button centers you back onto the pond, resetting to the default map view.
